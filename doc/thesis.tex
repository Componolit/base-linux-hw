	\chapter{State of the art}
		At the present time we are surrounded by devices that run complex software and operating systems.
		The number of these devices is still rising and their complexity is growing by the increasing amount computational resources, functionalities and interfaces.
		Also many of these devices are taking over important tasks such as smart locks or even cardiac pacemakers.
		Since most of these devices are connected to the public Internet they cannot only be accessed by their owners but anyone.
		These facts raise the question if we can trust these devices.
		Many cases in the present have shown that nearly all of these devices have security issues.
		Since the used systems are too complex to guarantee the absence of software errors the common practice is patching these devices when an error has been discovered.
		Unfortunately the approach of fixing errors has not proven reliable.
		Updates are often not or only for a short time available and often do not find their way to the end user.
		A difference to this practice are sectors where manufacturers are liable for the correctness of their products including software parts.
		This correctness is achieved by the separation of components and their individual evaluation and verification.
		The downside of this approach are the high costs, especially for a high amount of components.
		To reduce the costs multiple functionalities are often combined in one component.
		To securely separate the functionalities from each other separation kernels are used.
		Since those need to be secure they only consist of a low complexity and a few thousand lines of code.
		This reduction comes at the cost of flexibility at runtime which often lets vendors choose more complex but easy to use and configure systems.
		These often have a large trusted computing base (TCB) of multiple million lines of code.
		This leads to the question how this contradiction between flexibility and security can be resolved.
		
		\section{Genode}
		
		Genode aims to solve this problem through multiple ways.
		Instead of a monolithic kernel it uses microkernels.
		They provide a greater flexibility than separation kernels why keeping the size of the trusted computing base at a manageable level.
		This is accomplished for example by running device drivers as separate user space processes.
		User space applications in Genode are also managed by capabilities.
		They provide a way to allow and deny access to a certain number of system resources without the need for a global complex policy.
		Additionally to capabilities resources can be managed in a hierarchical way.
		Software components can be be partitioned into parts of different complexity.
		This helps to exclude complex parts from the trusted computing base and therefore reduce the amount of code that needs to be verified.
		The continuation of this approach leads to an application specific trusted computing base that consists of the application itself and all the parts it depends on [\ref{fig:tcb_tree}].

		The Genode OS framework is the implementation of this architecture for highly secure special purpose operating systems.
		Mainly written in C++ it scales from embedded systems with only a few megabytes of memory to big systems with dynamic workloads.
		The architecture consists of a recursive sandbox structure.
		Those are controlled from their parents and separated from their siblings.
		But they can create additional sandboxes and subtrees of children.
		This creates hierarchical structures and reduces the attack surface of the system since a compromised component cannot access resources of other components.
		These components are small blocks that can create complex systems without unnecessarily increasing the trusted computing base.
		Beside being programs they can also provide other functionalities such as device drivers or protocol stacks.
		
		Genode supports multiple CPU architectures such as Intel i386 and ARM.
		Multiple microkernels such as NOVA and seL4 can be used.
		Additionally Genode provides a custom kernel implementation that in comparison to other kernels further reduces the trusted computing base.
		The current framework also provides many usable driver and application components.
		Beside common periphery drivers such as USB and Intel wireless this also includes complex application frameworks such as Qt5. \citep{genode}
		
		To debug components in the development process Genode can also be started on the current running Linux kernel.
		This is a good approach for applications but is also limited.
		Some resources cannot be used since the Linux kernel doesn't provide them to the user space, for example memory mapped IO or direct memory access.
		To develop and debug native Genode device drivers the kernel needs to act as a microkernel and provide access to these resources in Genode.
		
		\section{User space drivers on Linux}
		
		There have already been different approaches on using suer space drivers on Linux.
		A, in the Linux world widely known, project is Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE).
		It's target is to provide users with the ability to use custom file systems without the need to require root privileges or edit kernel code.
		To achieve this FUSE consists of two parts, a kernel module and a user space library.
		The library communicates with the kernel module to provide the necessary functionality to the user.
		While this does not access any hardware resources it shows a concept how kernel resources can be accessed from the user space. \citep{fuse}
		
		Another approach is Userspace I/O (UIO).
		UIO addresses industrial systems that often require I/O cards which only need some mapped memory and interrupts.
		These cards are available as device files on Linux which provide access to the address space of each device.
		Contrary to FUSE UIO drivers require a small kernel module that deploys access to hardware resources.
		But the driver logic can be implemented in user space.
		This gives a number of advantages for both the programmer and the user.
		Instead of kernel modules these drivers can use many tools and libraries that are not available in the kernel.
		Also bugs and crashes of the driver do not influence the kernel itself.
		While updates of kernel modules often require the recompilation of the kernel or at least a reboot of the system updates of these drivers can be done more easily. \citep{uio}
		
		\section{Rump kernels}
		A rump kernel provides a lightweight environment for drivers on top of an anykernel.
		The flexible anykernel architecture allows kernels to run in different configurations or modes.
		They can be created from a monolithic kernel with a moderate effort.
		While they provide an interface for rump based drivers they also preserve their monolithic properties and driver stacks. \citep{kantee}
		
		Drivers on top of a rump kernel only need to interface with it and not the underlying kernel.
		That makes this concept portable to highly different platforms such as monolithic or micro kernels.
		This is achieved by stripping away all unneeded components of a kernel and only leaving those required for drivers to work.
		At the lower part of the kernel exists a small and well defined portability layer to interface with the underlying environment.
		These concepts were implemented first by the NetBSD project. \citep{bsd_rump}\citep{fosdem_rump}\citep{rump}
		
		Rump applications and drivers are created using the so called Hypercall API.
		There are two main parts of this API.
		The first one are basic calls for applications such as those for allocating memory or using threads.
		The second is about handling I/O operations and is splitted into a virtual and a physical part.
		The virtualized calls access services provided by the host operating system such as network interfaces and protocols. \citep{rump_man} \citep{rump_platform}
		
		While system calls and access to the host systems interfaces is defined straightforward direct hardware access is not.
		With one exception the rump kernel does not have support to directly map physical memory.
		These mappings are usually represented as files on the host system.
		While these files could be used to map memory into the rump kernel they would also limit the platforms and environments where it can be hosted.
		The only exception to this are vnodes which are inode representations in memory.
		The approach of the rump kernel to solve this problem is to allocate a block of memory and copy the contents of the memory mapped by the host system back and forth.
		This works only because the vnode pages can be accessed by a single consumer at a time.
		Therefore this approach is inapplicable for memory mapped IO or volatile memory. \citep{kantee}
		
		Another important aspect of hardware drivers are interrupts.
		Hardware interrupts usually preempt the CPU which is not supported by the rump kernel.
		Instead they are implemented as host threads which then schedule the handler inside the rump kernel accordingly. \citep{kantee}
		
		While these properties speak against hardware drivers in the first place there is one example of a hardware device driver for USB devices described.
		Yet this example operates on a higher level than direct access to hardware resources.
		The BSD kernel makes USB devices accessible to the user space via \texttt{ugen} the USB generic device support.
		The rump kernel implementation of the USB driver allows to configure the access to specific USB devices at compile time. \citep{kantee} \citep{ugen}

		\section{Integration into Genode}
		The integration into Genode is done by creating a base directory.
		This is used to build a core binary which then is executed by the kernel.
		Since there is already a core that is able to use the Linux kernel it would be redundant to rewrite these parts.
		Reusing the already available code can be done in three different ways.
	
		\subsection{Copy base-linux}
		The simplest way to build upon base-linux is creating a copy it in a new base directory.
		The advantage of this approach lies in the fact that there is, beside including the new directory, no need to modify upstream code.
		On the other hand this leads to code duplication and any updates of base-linux probably need to be ported to its modified copy.
	
		\subsection{Include base-linux}
		Creating a new base directory and including the needed contents from base-linux via Makefile fragments.
		While this would include the advantages of the copy based approach there is less to no code duplication.
		The disadvantage here is the complexity due to the build system that does not provide a standard way to include parts of other base directories.
	
		\subsection{Extend base-linux}
		To prevent both code duplication and complex includes the already existing base directory could be used and extended.
		While this approach seems to be easier it has two caveats.
		Since it requires modifications of the original base-linux core the current functionality needs to be maintained.
		This can be done either by creating a hybrid core that is able to run like the current one and on a bare Linux kernel or a switch needs to be added that chooses the target on build time.
		Additionally this code needs to be brought upstream as it cannot be plugged into the source tree like a separate base directory.
		
		\section{IO Ports}
		
		The implementation of of the \texttt{IO\_Port} session on Linux can be done straight forward.
		This is because IO ports are already available in the user space.
		The only requirement to use them is access to priveledge level 3 which can be achieved with root access on Linux.
		There are several methods that can be used and need to be implemented to use these ports.
		An example are \texttt{unsigned char inb(unsigned short int port)} and \texttt{void outb(unsigned char value, unsigned short int port)} which are used to respectively read and write a single byte to a specific port address.
		To use these functions the permissions need to be granted first.
		This can be done either by \texttt{int iopl(int level)} or \texttt{int ioperm(unsigned long from, unsigned long num, int turn\_on)} which are explained subsequently. \citep{outb} \citep{ioperm} \citep{iopl}
				
		\subsection{iopl}
		
		The first option, \texttt{iopl} grants the calling process a specific privilege level.
		On Linux these levels range from zero to three where zero is the level of a normal process and 3 is the highest one.
		These privileges are also inherited by child processes created by \texttt{fork} or \texttt{execve}. \citep{iopl}
		
		On Genode core would call \texttt{iopl} once it starts and creates the \texttt{IO\_Port} session.
		A component would access these ports through the session interface which also regulates the port ranges.
		
		\subsection{ioperm}
		
		\texttt{ioperm} is a more fine grained option to get the required privileges.
		Instead of \texttt{iopl} it does not give the calling process a higher privilege level but only access to a certain range of IO ports.
		This needs to be specified on the call by passing the starting port and the amount of ports that are accessed consecutively.
		It also does not allow processes to access overlapping port ranges. \citep{ioperm}
		
		The approach on Genode is to call this syscall when a client connects to the \texttt{IO\_Port} session with the required port ranges.
		This would not collide with the checks implemented in Genode but would provide the enforcement of these constraints on kernel level.
		
		\section{Memory mapped IO}
		
		While memory mapped IO is much more important that IO ports Linux does not provide a good interface to use it from the user space.
		It only has a \texttt{mem} device that has all physical memory mapped into a file.
		while this is an easy method to map memory into a user space process it has some disadvantages especially in regard to Genodes security and process isolation.
		If those disadvantages shall be avoided a custom adoption of kernel space needs to be done.
		This goal can be achieved in multiple ways.
		
		Also while there are multiple already existing solutions to write user space drivers these usually either pull dependencies behind or are too complex for the goal of a minimized kernel.
		
		\subsection{Memory device}
		
		The easiest would be using \texttt{/dev/mem} which already has mapped all physical memory into the user space.
		While on early kernel versions it was possible to access the whole memory current versions have the \texttt{CONFIG\_STRICT\_DEVMEM} configuration option enabled which only allows access to IO memory but not arbitrary RAM.
		
		Yet any process that holds a file descriptor can still access all IO ranges and therefore control nearly all hardware devices.
		This cannot be constrained in any way which is a danger to Genodes process isolation.
		While only core is able to open the file descriptor and pass it to a component the component needs to map the memory by itself.
		Since it can map arbitrary regions of memory it would be able to control devices or interfere with other drivers without core having the ability to control or restrict such an action.
		As this strongly violates the security assumptions this option should only be implemented if any other fails. \citep{devmem} 
		
		\subsection{System call}
		
		A more fine grained and better controllable solution would be a custom system call.
		It could be implemented to take the offset and size of the memory region and map it directly into the user space.
		Also Genode specific attributes could be used since there is no constraint in available functionality.
		
		While this is a powerful solution it comes with certain limitations.
		System calls cannot be added by kernel modules and need to be implemented directly inside the kernel.
		This does not only require the the kernel to be compiled for each device but also a manual upgrade each time a new version is released.
		Also a syscall number needs to be chosen that does not collide with any existing one.
		While this sounds easy in the first place it either requires the number registrated by kernel developers to prevent collisions or to reassign it in future versions.
		So beside this being a powerful way to enable user space memory mapping it also requires a higher maintenance over time. \citep{syscall}
		
		\subsection{SysFS}
		
		The Linux \texttt{sysfs} which is located in \texttt{/sys} is a common way to enable communication between user space applications and the kernel.
		This is usually done by accessing files in \texttt{/sys}.
		An implementation of such a driver would provide a file that the arguments are placed into; for example the space separated name, offset and size of the regarded memory region.
		It would then place an correspondingly named device file into ts directory that the user space process can open and map. \citep{sysfs}
		
		As this enables the driver to selectively make memory regions accessible, even to specific users only, this would fit Genodes security model.
		Core would be responsible to set the correct arguments into the input file and the component could open and map the file according to its capabilities.
		
		Yet there are some disadvantages, especially in regards to complexity.
		Mapping a memory region would need multiple file operations.
		Also the direct access to files in \texttt{/sys} is disregarded since the structure of the file system can change.
		To prevent effects of these changes it is recommended to use an abstraction layer such a udev or HAL.
		These dependencies would furthermore increase the complexity of this approach.
		Since Genodes \texttt{base-linux} does not depend yet on sysfs it could be removed from the kernel later.
		That would not be true anymore if this approach was chosen. \citep{sysfs}
